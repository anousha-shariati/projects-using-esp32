This project demonstrates how to work with the ESP32 microcontroller by exploring its GPIO, UART, WiFi, and I2C functionalities. Each step in this project builds upon the ESP32â€™s capabilities, providing hands-on practice with different modules and interfaces.

Project Components:

GPIO Control: Program the ESP32 to toggle a GPIO pin, controlling an LED with a 2-second delay.

UART Communication: Use UART for debugging by outputting the LED state to the serial terminal.

WiFi Connectivity: Connect the ESP32 to a WiFi network and host a web server displaying a "Hello World" message.

I2C Communication with LM75 Sensor: Use I2C to communicate with an LM75 temperature sensor and display readings on the terminal.

Prerequisites:

Hardware: ESP32 board, LED, resistor, LM75 temperature sensor (or compatible I2C sensor)

Software: Arduino IDE with ESP32 board support

Libraries: Ensure the Arduino IDE includes libraries for WiFi and I2C communication (e.g., Wire.h for I2C)
